            <h3> Lahore Fort</h3>
              The Lahore Fort, locally referred to as Shahi Qila is citadel of the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is located in the northwestern corner of the Walled City of Lahore. 
               The trapezoidal composition is spread over 20 hectares.

                Origins of the fort go as far back as antiquity, however, the existing base structure was built during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605), and was regularly upgraded by subsequent rulers, having thirteen gates in all.Thus the fort manifests the rich traditions of Mughal architecture.Some of the famous sites inside the fort include: Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Gate, Naulakha pavilion, and Moti Masjid. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the Shalimar Gardens (Lahore). 
                
                <h3> Badshahi Masjid</h3>
                The Badshahi Mosque , or the 'Emperor's Mosque', was
                built in 1673 by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in Lahore.
                It is one of the city's best known landmarks, and a major tourist attraction
                and characterizes the beauty and greatness of the Mughal era.

                Capable of accommodating over 55,000 worshipers.
                It is the second largest mosque in Pakistan, after the Faisal Mosque in
                Islamabad.
                The architecture and design of the Badshahi Masjid is closely related to the
                Jama Masjid in Delhi, India, which was built in 1648 by Aurangzeb's father
                and predecessor, Emperor Shah Jahan.
                The Imam-e-Kaaba (Sheikh Abdur-Rahman Al-Sudais of Saudi Arabia) has
                 also led prayers in this mosque in 2007. 

                <h3> Ketas Temple</h3>
                It is located on the main road leading from Lake Kallar Kahar to Choa Saidan Shah and is not far from the Lake.Built in the 9th-11th century when the Salt Range was part of the powerful Hindu Kingdom of Kashmir, this large complex houses several temples most of which, unfortunately, are in a rather derelict condition. There is also a fortress surrounding a pool.
                  Legend has it that the pool was formed by the tears of the Hindu God Shiva while weeping over his dead wife. 

                According to an Indian website I looked up, the pool reportedly has "magical powers" and is mentioned in the great Indian epic Mahabharata. The Katas Temple Complex used to be a major place of pilgrimage for the Hindus before the partition of India in 1947 and to this day several devotees visit it in spring every year. 

                There is talk that it may be placed on the World Heritage List and a joint India-Pakistan project to restore and renovate it is under discussion. 

                The Katas site houses the Satgraha, a group of seven ancient temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, a few medieval temples, havelis and some recently constructed temples, scattered around a pond considered holy by Hindus. The temples at Katas are mostly constructed on square platforms. The elevation of the sub shrines seems to form a series of cornices with small rows of pillars, crowned by a ribbed dome.

                The Ramachandra Mandir is situated to the east of the Hari Singh Haveli and is closed from all sides except for an entrance on the east. The double-storied structure has eight rooms of various dimensions on the ground floor and a staircase at the south leading to the first floor. The mandir has two jharokas (balconies) that have been severely damaged.

                The Hanuman Mandir is on the western extreme of a high rectangular enclosure with entrances on the south and the north. The temple's ceiling is undecorated, and lime-plastered. The Shiva temple is also built on a square platform. Its entrance is a recessed round arch with faint cusps and a rectangular opening to the north.

                Katasraj temple complex is believed to date back to the Mahabharata era. There are stories about the Pandavas spending time there during their long exile. The lake in the complex is believed to have magical powers and supposed to be where Yudhisthira defeated the Yaksha with his wisdom to bring his brothers back to life. 
                <h3>Shalimar Garden</h3>
                The Shalimar Gardens, sometimes written Shalamar Gardens, is a Persian garden and it was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in Lahore, modern day Pakistan. Construction began in 1641 A.D. (1051 A.H.) and was completed the following year. The project management was carried out under the superintendence of Khalilullah Khan, a noble of Shah Jahan's court, in cooperation with Ali Mardan Khan and Mulla Alaul Maulk Tuni. The Shalimar Gardens are located near Baghbanpura along the Grand Trunk Road some 5 kilometers northeast of the main Lahore city. 

                The Gardens have been laid out from south to north in three descending terraces, which are elevated by 4–5 metres (13-15 feet) above one another. The three terraces have names in Urdu as follows:

                The upper terrace named Farah Baksh meaning Bestower of Pleasure. 
                The middle terrace named Faiz Baksh meaning Bestower of Goodness. 
                 The lower terrace named Hayat Baksh meaning Bestower of life.

                <br /> 
                 he site of the Shalimar Gardens originally belonged to one of the noble Zaildar families in the region, well known as Mian Family Baghbanpura. The family was also given the Royal title of 'Mian' by the Mughal Emperor, for its services to the Empire. Mian Muhammad Yusuf, then the head of the Mian family, donated the site of Ishaq Pura to the Emperor Shah Jahan, after pressure was placed on the family by the royal engineers who wished to build on the site due to its good position and soil. In return, Shah Jahan granted the Mian family governance of the Shalimar Gardens. The Shalimar Gardens remained under the custodianship of this family for more than 350 years.

                 In 1962, the Shalimar Gardens were nationalised by General Ayub Khan because leading Mian family members had opposed his imposition of martial law in Pakistan.

                 The Mela Chiraghan festival used to take place in the Gardens, until President Ayub Khan ordered against it in 1958. 
                 <h3>Multan Fort</h3>
                 Multan Fort was built on a mound separating it form the city by the old bed of river Ravi. There is no Fort now as it was destroyed by the British Garrison which was stationed ,there for a long time, but the entire site is known as the Fort .The walls of the fort were built by Murad Baksh, the son of the Shah Jahan, when he was the viceroy of Multan in the early 17th, century. The Fort site now looks as a part of the city, because instead of the river it is now separated by a road which looks more like a bazaar and remains crowded throughout the day.

                The Fort stands on the highest part of the mound on which the town is built, It is an ancient structure formed by a hexagonal wall from forty to seventy feet high, the longest side of which faces the north-west and extends for 600 yards, and which isolates it from the town. Within the fort, and on a very considerable elevation, stands the citadel, in itself of very great strength. The walls are flanked by thirty towers, and enclose numerous houses, mosques, a Hindu temple of high antiquity, and a khan’ s palace the beauty of which was severely damaged by the bettering it got from the guns of Ranjeet Sing in 1818.
