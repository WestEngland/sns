         <h2> Deserts</h2>
          Deserts in Pakistan constitute a significant part of the country’s geography, especially in the central and south-eastern regions.
             The major deserts of Pakistan include Thar, Cholistan, Thall and Kharan deserts.

            <h3>Thar Desert</h3>
            Thar Desert is the largest among all and mostly falls under the territory of Sind province, extending eastwards from irrigated plains on the left bank of River Indus towards the Indian states of of Rajhistan and Gujrat, constituting the largest desert in South Asia, also known as the Great Indian Desert. The approximate area of greater Thar Desert in total is around 200,000 square KM, of which around 50,000 square KM falls in the Pakistani territories, covering the districts of Tharparker, Mirpur Khas, Umerkot, Khairpur, Sukkar and Ghotki in Sindh Province.

            Thar desert is among the most populated deserts of the world. The total estimated population living in these Thar Desert districts, according to 1998 census, is around 4.5 million. Most of the population in these district live in settled cities and villages, however a significant of number of people live deep inside the desert and live a nomadic life style and depends heavily on raring livestock for their livelihoods. Thar dwellers are most famous for their colourful culture, of traditions and unique arts. The vegetation type can be classified as Tropical Thorn Forest, comprising of scattered trees and bushes, mainly thorny and drought resistant species and grasses etc. However, whenever there are rains lush green grasses sprout all over providing rich source of fodder.

            There are different theories on the origin of the Thar Desert, some estimates that the desert formation is relatively recent from 2000-1500 BC, this is also the time when the famous Ghaggar-Hakra rivers ceased to exist due to changes in physiological and climatic conditions. Whereas others estimate that desertification in the region started much earlier from 4000 to 10,000 years or even beyond.
             
            <h3>Cholistan Desert</h3>

            The Cholistan Desert, locally known as Rohi, constitutes the south eastern region of Punjab Province with an estimated area of 26,000 square KM, covering the districts of Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan and Bahawalnagar. Towards the eastern flanks Cholistan extends into the Indian states of Rajhistan and Punjab and joins the greater Thar Desert. While on the north-western front it is bordered by the irrigated plains of Indus and Sutlaj rivers. 
            In ancient times the Hakra River use to flow through the area, along the banks of which a number of Indus Valley civilization settlements have been discovered, however the river had long dried up. Beside the unique landscape and unique nomadic culture, the major attractions of Cholistan include Lal Suhanra National Park, Drawar Fort and Annual Desert Car Rally, the biggest motor sport event in Pakistan.

           <h3>Thar Desert</h3>

            Thal desert is the third largest desert in Pakistan, situated in the central Punjab it covers an estimated area of 20,000 Square KM. It is boarded by Indus and Jhelum Rivers on its western and eastern flanks respectively and, in the north it meets the foothills of Salt Range of Potohar Plateau. Administratively the Thall desert mainly falls in the districts of Bhakkar, Khushab, Mianwali, Jhang, Layyah, and Muzaffargarh and is supporting a considerable population of 9.4 Million (1998 Census). Most of the area is barren wasteland with scanty drought resistant trees, shrubs and grasses. However, unlike the Thar and Cholistan deserts considerable efforts have been made, through building the greater Thall Canal and tube welling to bring considerable desert areas under cultivation.
            Furthermore in contrast to Thar and Cholistan the roads network in Thall desert is well established and people are living more settled lifestyle, widely practicing irrigated and rain-fed agriculture.
